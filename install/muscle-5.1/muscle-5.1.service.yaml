name: MUSCLE
description: MUSCLE is one of the best-performing multiple alignment 
  programs according to published benchmark tests, with accuracy and 
  speed that are consistently better than CLUSTALW. MUSCLE can align 
  hundreds of sequences in seconds. Most users learn everything they 
  need to know about MUSCLE in a few minutesâ€”only a handful of 
  command-line options are needed to perform common alignment tasks.
